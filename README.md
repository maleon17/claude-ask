# claude-ask

> Part of **[telegram-ai](https://github.com/maleon17/telegram-ai)** — Claude/Codex ↔ Telegram, four ways.

A standalone Telegram userbot/backend for ClaudeAsk. It lets the owner
invoke Jarvis with the `.ask` command in any Telegram chat and perform real
actions through their own Telethon session. This is not the Bot API bridge
and not codex-ask.

Repository: <https://github.com/maleon17/claude-ask>

## Components

- `claude_ask.py` — the main loadable ClaudeAsk module;
- `claude_watcher.py` — the Claude Code backend with persistent sessions;
- `mcp_telegram_tools.py` — MCP tools for Telegram account actions;
- `cmd_queue.py` — the shared HTTP queue relay for `.ask` and `.xask`;
- `setup.sh` and service examples — backend infrastructure setup.

## Commands

ClaudeAsk uses `.ask`, `.search`, `.translate`, and `.new`. Triggers are
stored in the `ClaudeAsk` namespace. CodexAsk uses a separate history
namespace and `x`-prefixed commands, but deliberately reads the same trigger
namespace; the incoming-message watcher stays a single one, so triggers
aren't duplicated.

## Architecture

The userbot module sends a request to `/ask`, the worker processes it
through Claude Code and returns a progress/answer stream via
`/tmp/jarvisask_ask_*`. MCP calls land in `/tmp/jarvisask_tool_queue`; the module
holding a live Telethon session executes the action and returns the result.
Every action gets a real tool result first, and only then is it reflected
in the reply to the user.

The queue relay is shared infrastructure transport. If
`jarvis-ask-cmd-queue.service` is already running on the host, don't start a
second copy on the same ports/directories.

## Backend installation

Requirements: Linux, Python 3.10+, the Claude Code CLI authenticated via
`claude auth login --claudeai`, systemd (for running as a service). The
userbot itself must be installed separately — this project targets the
[Heroku](https://github.com/coddrago/Heroku) userbot; follow its own README
for installing and starting the userbot before loading `claude_ask.py` into
it. Heroku can run on a dedicated Telethon/Hikka host or in Docker on the
same machine as this backend — running it on a separate host is just this
deployment's own choice, not a requirement.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/maleon17/claude-ask.git
cd claude-ask
chmod +x setup.sh
./setup.sh
```

The script creates the MCP virtualenv, a local
`mcp_telegram_tools_config.json`, and a runtime directory. Service templates
need `__USER__` and `__INSTALL_DIR__` replaced; the queue relay should only
be installed once per host.

## Loading the module

Send the same `claude_ask.py` as a document to each userbot instance's
dedicated test Telegram channel and reply to the document with `.lm`. Then,
once per account, run `.asknet token <token>` and `.asknet local <instance_id>` or
`.asknet tailnet <instance_id> <backend_url>`. Settings persist across later
updates via `.dlm`. After loading, verify `.ask`, `.new`, and a request that
uses a real tool (`list_triggers`, `read_history`, or `search_chat`).

The queue relay's network address and the Mistral key for voice
transcription are set via environment variables
(`CLAUDE_JARVIS_BACKEND_URL`, `MISTRAL_API_KEY`); no secrets are stored in
the repository.

## Relay authentication

The relay refuses to start unless `JARVIS_RELAY_TOKENS_FILE` contains a
non-empty JSON map of `sha256(token)` to `instance_id`, and
`JARVIS_RELAY_OWNERS_FILE` contains the corresponding server-side map of
`instance_id` to Telegram owner ID. Store both files outside the checkout,
mode `0600`. Generate an entry (the raw token is printed once only):

```bash
JARVIS_RELAY_TOKENS_FILE=/etc/jarvis-ask/relay-tokens.json \
  python3 cmd_queue.py --add-token <instance_id>
```

Set `JARVIS_RELAY_BIND` to a comma-separated list of listen addresses; its
safe default is `127.0.0.1`. Set `JARVIS_RELAY_TOKEN` for a one-instance
local watcher/MCP or `JARVIS_RELAY_TOKENS_JSON` as a JSON instance-to-token
map when one watcher serves several instances. Remote userbots save their own token with
`.asknet token <token>`; the command only reports that it is configured.

The authenticated userbot reports `requester_id`; relay cannot independently
verify the original Telegram sender. This is the explicit trust boundary.
The relay nevertheless derives owner authorization on the server by comparing
that value with the owner ID configured for the token's instance, and never
accepts a client-provided owner flag. Requests, tool calls, results, personas,
resets and registered download artifacts are all scoped to that instance.

## Verification and updates

```bash
python3 -m py_compile claude_watcher.py cmd_queue.py mcp_telegram_tools.py
systemctl status jarvis-ask-watcher
journalctl -u jarvis-ask-watcher -f
```

A plain `docker cp` does not reload an already-running module.

## Updating

The loaded module reinstalls itself in place from the latest version on
`main`:

```text
.dlm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/maleon17/claude-ask/main/claude_ask.py
```

Each instance's saved `.asknet` configuration stays in Heroku's database, so
there's no need to reconfigure the network after an update.

## Product boundaries

`Claude-jarvis` is ClaudeAsk/the userbot. `Codex-jarvis` is the independent
CodexAsk and its app-server. `Codex-telegram-bot` is yet another independent
Bot API frontend. Only the queue relay and the trigger namespace are
deliberately shared.
